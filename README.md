# Hi, I'm CÃ©dric!

### I'm a French web and web mobile developer currently living in Paris area.

ðŸ”­ I always try to expand my knowledges and to learn new things, particulary on the web.

There, in August 2021, I quit my job as a export assistant to follow a full-time Javascript bootcamp in order to become a so-called web developer.

ðŸŒ± I am currently learning everything I can around the Javascript and mobile development ecosystem.

I love building API's and databases. I also love working with well designed apps!

### Some tools that  I use

âš¡ Fun facts: 

- After graduation, I made a **1000 days** backpacking trip trough Australia an Asia
During my time in Taiwan, I learned a bit of Mandarin Chinese and I created a [Taipei Timelapse](https://vimeo.com/numericnomade/taipei-timelapse).

- Beyong the web, but I am also a pastor (yes, that's right) in a church in Paris. So, I get to spend much time with a lot a different kind of people!
