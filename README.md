# Hi, I'm CÃ©dric!

### I'm a French web developer currently living in Paris area.

ðŸ”­ I always try to expand my knowledges and to learn new things, particulary on the web.

There, in August 2021, I quit my job as a export assistant to follow a full-time Javascript bootcamp in order to become a so-called fullstack web developer.

ðŸŒ± As you can guess, I am currently learning everything I can around the Javascript ecosystem.

I love playing with nodeJS, API and databases!

âš¡ Fun fact: 

- After graduation, I made a **1000 days** backpacking trip trough Australia an Asia
During my time in Taiwan, I learned a bit of Mandarin Chinese and I created a [Taipei Timelapse](https://vimeo.com/numericnomade/taipei-timelapse).

- Beyong the web, but I am also a pastor (yes, that's right) in a church in Paris. So, I get to spend much time with a lot a different kind of people!

ðŸ“« You can reach me though [my website](https://cedriccharlesia.com).

Cheers!
